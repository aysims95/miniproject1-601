## Forking

•When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository but the repository remains on your GitHub account.

•Forking is a concept 

## Cloning 
•When you clone a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine with the help of Git

•Cloning is a process


## Forking vs Repository 

•Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request. 

•Pull request knocks the repository owner and tell that “I have made some changes, please merge these changes to your repository if you like it”

•Users on a cloned repository can be pushed to the upstream repository directly.

•The user must have the write access for the repository otherwise this is not possible

•If the user does not have the write access, the only way to go is through the forked request

•The changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository and then a pull request is created

•It is a better option to fork before clone if the user is not declared as a contributor and it is a third party repository
