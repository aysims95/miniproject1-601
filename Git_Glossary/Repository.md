# *Repository* :card_index_dividers:
	A collection of commits with branches and tags to identify commits. A user can access all files in their local repository despite if they were working on one file or multiple files. Each repository belongs to a user/team where the user/team admin are the only people who can delete the repository. Users can view public repositories without creating an account as long as they have a url for the repository. An example of a repository is our project *MiniProject-1-Git-Collaboration.*
