# *Branch* :cactus:
Branches are lightweight, moveable counters for various commits. The default branch name in Git is master or main, and any feature or fix a user adds creates a new branch to store the changes.Branching allows users to clean up their process before merging into the main branch. You can access a branch with the command 'git branch Branch_Name'.
