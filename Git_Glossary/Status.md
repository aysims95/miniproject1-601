# *Status* :vertical_traffic_light:
The status command of git shows the working repository and the staging area. Users can see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. All you have to type is 'git status' to get information on the current repositoryl.
