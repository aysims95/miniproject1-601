# *Clone* :desktop_computer:
Cloning allows users to clone a repository into a new directory. This creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository. Clones also aid in recovering corrupted server disks by accessing the server in it's last cloned state. You can clone a reposity by using the command 'git clone <repository-url>'.
