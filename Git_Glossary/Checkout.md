# *Checkout* :dart:
	Git checkout is the process of switching between different versions of a target branch. Checking out branches is similar to checking out old commits and files as the working repository is updated to match the selected branch. A good way to think about **git checkout** is thinking it as a way to select the line of development that you're currently working on. You can check out a branch with the command **git checkout branch_name**
