# *Pull* :arrow_down:
A pull allows for users to fetch from and integrate with a remote repository or a local branch, and immediately update the local repository to match that content. A pull command is a combination of 'git fetch' and 'git merge'. You can use the command 'git pull <remote>' to begin downloading and merging content from a remote repository.
